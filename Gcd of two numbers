Problem:Gcd of two numbers
Algorithm: To find the Greatest Common divisor(Gcd) of two numbers.
1.Start.
2.Define a class named Solution.
3.Inside the class Solution, define a static method named gcd that takes two integers a and b as input and returns an integer representing their greatest common divisor.
4.Check if b is equal to 0:
 a. If true, return a as the GCD.
5.If b is not equal to 0:
 a. Recursively call the gcd function with arguments b and a % b.
 b. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until b becomes 0.
6.End.
Code:
class Solution {
    public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        // code here
        if(b==0)
        return a;
        else
        return gcd(b,a%b);
    }
}
Time Complexity: 
  The time complexity for this code is O(log(min(a,b)));
