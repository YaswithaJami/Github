Problem: Find the Median
Algorithm: To Finding the mean for array of Integers after Sorting
1.Start.
2.Define a class named Solution.
3.Inside the class Solution, define a method named find_median that takes an integer array v as input and returns an integer representing the median.
4.Sort the array v in non-decreasing order using Arrays.sort(v).
5.Get the length of the array v and store it in the variable n.
6.Check if the length of the array v is odd (n % 2 == 1):
 a. If true, return the middle element of the sorted array v, which is v[n/2].
7.If the length of the array v is even:
 a. Get the two middle elements of the sorted array v and store them in variables mid1 and mid2, calculated as v[n/2 - 1] and v[n/2], respectively.
 b. Return the average of mid1 and mid2, calculated as (mid1 + mid2) / 2.
8.End.
Code:
class Solution
{
    public int find_median(int[] v)
    {
        // Code here
        Arrays.sort(v);
        int n=v.length;
        if(n % 2==1)
        {
            return v[n/2];
        }
        else
        {
            int mid1=v[n/2 -1];
            int mid2=v[n/2];
            return (mid1+mid2)/2;
        }
        
    }
}
