Problem:Sum Of Series
Algorithm: To calculates the sum of the series of natural numbers up to a given integer n.
1.Import the Scanner class from java.util package.

2.Define a class named Solution.

3.Inside the class Solution, define a static method named seriesSum that takes an integer n as input and returns a long.

4.Initialize variables i and sum to 0.

5.Iterate from 1 to n using a for loop:

 a. Add the current value of i to sum.

6.After the loop, return the value of sum.

7.Define the main method:

 a. Create a Scanner object named sc to read input from the console.

 b. Read an integer n from the user using sc.nextInt().

 c. Call the seriesSum method with n as an argument and print the result using System.out.println().
Code:
 class Solution {
    public static long seriesSum(int n) {
        // code here
       
        return ((long)n*(long)(n+1))/2;
    }
 }
Time Complexity:
 The time complexity of this code is independent of the input size n, making it O(1) or constant time complexity.
