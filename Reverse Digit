Problem: Reverse digit
Algorithm:To Find reverses the digits of a given number n without leading zeroes. 
1.Start.
2.Define a class named Solution.
3.Inside the class Solution, define a method named reverse_digit that takes a long integer n as input and returns a long integer representing the reversed number.
4.Initialize a long variable s to store the reversed number.
5.While n is greater than 0:
 a. Find the last digit of n by taking the remainder when divided by 10 (n % 10) and store it in the variable digit.
 b. Update s by multiplying it by 10 and adding digit.
 c. Divide n by 10 to remove the last digit.
6.After the loop, return the value of s as the reversed number.
7.End.
Code:
class Solution
{
    public long reverse_digit(long n)
    {
        // Code here
        long s=0;
        while(n>0)
        {
            long digit=n%10;
            s=(s*10)+digit;
            n/=10;
        }
        
           return s;
    }
}
