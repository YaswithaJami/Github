Problem: Pow of pow
Algorithm:
1.The code uses a formula to calculate the sum of squares of the first n even numbers:
4*(n*(n+1)*(2n+1))/6;
2.The formula involves basic arithmetic operations: multiplication, addition, and division.
3.The formula computes the sum of squares of even numbers from 2 to 
2 to 2n;
Code:
class Solution
{
    public long sum_of_square_evenNumbers(long n)
    {
        // we used the formula for this and take n value from user and then substitute in formula to get our desired output
          return 4*((n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 6);

    }
}
Time complexity: O(1) (constant time complexity).
Space complexity: O(1) (constant space complexity).
