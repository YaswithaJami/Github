Problem: Dice problem
Algorithm: Calculate the opposite face of a dice by subtracting the input face number from 7.
1.Subtract the input face number N from 7 (since opposite faces on a standard six-sided die always sum up to 7).
2.Return the result, which represents the opposite face of the given face number N.
Time complexity: O(1) (constant time complexity).
Space complexity: O(1) (constant space complexity).
Code:
class Solution{
    static int oppositeFaceOfDice(int N){
        // code here
        return 7 - N;
    }
}
